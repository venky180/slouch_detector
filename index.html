            <h2>Posture Monitoring System</h2>
            <p>This project is a real-time posture monitoring system using computer vision techniques. It uses the webcam of a computer to analyze the user's posture and provide feedback on their sitting position. The system detects and tracks the user's face and shoulders, calculates the relative distance between them, and analyzes various angles and ratios to determine the posture quality.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Posture-related problems are widespread, with 80% of Americans experiencing issues. Poor sitting posture can lead to discomfort and health complications. The Slouch Detector project aims to provide real-time feedback on sitting posture using computer vision technologies, promoting better spinal alignment and reducing health risks.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="motivation">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Due to the prevalence of posture-related problems, there's a need for proactive measures. The Slouch Detector project, leveraging MediaPipe and OpenCV, offers real-time feedback to users, helping them monitor and correct their sitting posture. The goal is to empower individuals to adopt healthier habits and prevent future health complications.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="goals">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The primary goals of the Slouch Detector project include continuous real-time monitoring of sitting posture, providing immediate feedback to users, offering guidelines for posture maintenance, and ensuring minimal setup and device requirements. The project aims to make posture monitoring accessible and user-friendly for widespread adoption.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="approach">
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>The Slouch Detector project utilizes OpenCV for computer vision tasks, including video capture for real-time monitoring. MediaPipe Pose is employed for accurate body pose estimation, enabling the detection of slouching or poor posture. The project also leverages Plyer for cross-platform notifications. The approach involves a combination of technologies to achieve real-time monitoring, immediate feedback, and posture-related features.</p>
