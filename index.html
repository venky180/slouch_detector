            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>The Slouch Detector project utilizes OpenCV for computer vision tasks, including video capture for real-time monitoring. MediaPipe Pose is employed for accurate body pose estimation, enabling the detection of slouching or poor posture. The project also leverages Plyer for cross-platform notifications. The approach involves a combination of technologies to achieve real-time monitoring, immediate feedback, and posture-related features.</p>
